# Voreon üêâ
This is my personal Voron config repository where I save my important 3d printer files. I also mainly have
this repository because I couldn't find configs that would match my case, so I thought my modified configs
could help someone.

I built my Voron from a FYSETC kit (Voron V2.4 r2 pro) but I have had some issues with the provided drivers,
so I have swapped them for BigTreeTech ones which have worked fine. Before that I had Fysetc silent tmc2209
v4.0 which didn't want to work in uart mode and neither in standalone.
